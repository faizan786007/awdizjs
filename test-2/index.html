        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>All of my life, I loved exploring and finding beautiful places. I loved climbing that mountain, getting to the top of that building, climbing that jungle gym. It was fun for me. I have had many fun experiences doing this, and this story I wish to tell you is one of the most interesting, because I have the most fun exploring the unknown.

            During the summer, I went to a nearby park called Prophetstown. Itâ€™s a park with a recreated farm from the times of William Henry Harrison and Tecumseh. During my exploring, I came across a fence behind a forest. I managed to squeeze through it, and found a very large hole, around 100 wide, 30 feet deep, and at least a quarter mile in length. </p>

            <h3>Welcome to My Adventures</h3>
            <p>I base my adventures from my home in Seattle, Washington. Sometimes my adventures are just a bus ride away, but other times, they involve exhausting flights to far away international locations. This blog covers not only my adventures, but the conditioning and training that keeps me fit and ready. Thank you for being a part of the journey!</p>
            <h3>My Passion for Fitness</h3>
            <p>I wasn't always an active person. After some setbacks in my health, I joined up with a gym. That gym offered a number of outings. Once I saw what I could do with a stronger, fitter body, I was hooked. Since starting this journey, I have climbed mountains and kayaked down rivers. I have gone in caves and up canyons. My passion for fitness is based on living life to its fullest.</p>
            <h3>Start Where You Are</h3>
            <p>Every day, meet yourself where you are. My stories and tips might not be for where you are, but you can adapt them to your own adventure. What challenges you today? Let's face those challenges together as a team. Send me a message about what fitness challenges you are overcoming in your active life. I might just feature your story in an upcoming blog post.</p>
